              All of our meals are single serving and meant to feed an average
              adult. Our 6-meal plan is perfect for a person looking for 6
              dinners (or lunches!) a week. On average, our meals weigh in at
              just about 13 ounces, which is about 10% larger than similar
              competitors. What’s even better: our meals average just 500
              calories and range from 300 to 650 calories. If you have a larger
              household, we do offer a 12 meal per week subscription (it’s
              perfect for a family of 4 looking for 3 meals per week). Plus, you
              can always order multiple subscriptions.

              to place an order that fits your preferences now, be sure to check
              back frequently as we’re always adding new and exciting dishes. On
              average, our weekly rotation of 30+ dishes includes: ‍ Under 500
              calories: 20+ meals Under 35 grams of carbs: 8–10 meals

              Our meals are chef prepared and delivered fresh, so typically they
              have a refrigerated shelf life of about 3-5 days. Select items
              (such as seafood) are best eaten first, so we’ll add a badge on
              the package to let you know. We usually suggest enjoying these
              meals within the first few days of receiving your order, but you
              can always check their exact use-by date on the back-of-pack
              nutrition label. If you’re ever unable to finish your meals within
              their shelf life, you can always pop them into the freezer for
              extended storage. Just be sure to microwave your meal straight
              from the freezer and add a few extra minutes to reach the 165° F
              internal temperature we recommend.

              Your meals will come to you fully prepared so you just have to
              heat ‘em up in the microwave. On the back of each meal, you’ll
              find our easy steps for heating, but generally, the meals heat up
              in about 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). If you’re
              unsure, start at 2 minutes and heat in 30–second increments until
              the meal reaches an inner temperature of 165° F. Our meals are
              packaged to be heated in the microwave (for the ultimate
              convenience), but you can heat them in the oven if you’d like.
              Just so you know, our current meal containers aren’t safe for the
              oven or stovetop, so you’ll have to transfer your food to heat it
              up. You can check out the full oven reheat directions in our FAQ.
